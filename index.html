    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am 23 years old and grew up on the Isle of Wight.
        I studied Maths at the University of York and graduated in July 2020. 
        In my third year I took part in the Erasmus programme and studied in Madrid, completely in Spanish!
        It was a very challenging year but I am so glad I did it.
