                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am 23 years old and grew up on the Isle of Wight.
                    I like to bake cakes for my family and watch very cheesy films with my friends.

                    I studied maths at the University of York and graduated in July 2020. 
                    In my third year I took part in the Erasmus programme and studied in Madrid, completely in Spanish!
                    It was a very challenging year but I am so glad I did it.

                    When I was younger, I was a competitive swimmer and represented the Isle of Wight a number of times.
                    I also worked as a lifeguard at my local pool and helped out with swimming lessons for a number of years.
